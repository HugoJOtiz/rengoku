Compared to 2020, 2021 was pretty happening for me. I was really busy at work pretty much the entire year. It's not like I only worked, I also learned a lot. I know that we're already 15 days into 2020 and it's really late for review kind of thing but here we are. 

After spending almost an year at home in 2020, we were finally able to return back to college in January. We were really happy going back to college after a long time and did all kind of fun things. It was our last year, so we moved to a new hostel building and enjoyed our remaining days in the campus. I had to manage both work and partying with friends. It was a bit hard but I enjoyed a lot.
