**Demon Slayer** has been my favourite anime since it started airing. It's needless to say that the **infinity train** movie has taken the popularity of the franchise to another level. **Kyōjurō Rengoku** is an amazing character which I really liked throughout the movie. I tried to design a minimal theme for **vitepress** following the colors that make rengoku so fascinating.

The theme in itself is very straightforward, it provides the bare minimum features for a blog, has a very simple and minimal design just the way I like and most importantly it's runs on top of **vitepress**. This is going to be the new theme of my website. I have plans to keep it in active development and push some new features like a docs theme in futire. This is it, if you liked the theme follow the [Documentation](../blog/docs.md) to get started.
