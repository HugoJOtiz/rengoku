It is my 3rd year of putting together a piece on how I spent the last 365 days. Writing it every year is becoming a drag. But I also feel that sense of responsibility after penning it down. This year's been mostly good. I couldn't land on the moon for sure, but I was able to fly at least.

I don't have much to write. I've rewritten this some ten times. TLDR; I wrote various kinds of software [this year](https://github.com/soulsam480?tab=overview&from=2023-12-01&to=2023-12-29). I always wanted to get a camera and finally bought it. I still don't know how I'm able to ride a bike. But thanks to [Shiva](https://www.instagram.com/arvaimhusk/), this help is priceless. I'm forever indebted. [Soumya](https://github.com/SoumyaRanjanNaik) moved to Bengaluru. We got excited about pursuing our older projects. Looking back, I can see we failed there. Did many road trips with Shiva and climbed [Shivagange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivagange), [Madhugiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhugiri), [Bilikal Rangaswamy Betta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilikal_Rangaswamy_Betta), and [Savandurga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savandurga). Wow, that was a mouthful. Fell sick with dengue and it was freaking painful. Thanks to my cousins, aadi and akka, I recovered quickly. Also started reading books. Thanks to Anne, I'm on track to finish 20 books before I turn 30. 

The other half was not that happening. At [RevenueHero](https://revenuehero.io/) we shipped tons of new things this year. You can read about that [here](https://www.revenuehero.io/blog/revenuehero-wrapped-2023). This year I handled myself better. I became better at handling emotional loss and gained clarity about what I want and what's right. I still have a long way to go to be a better person. I'm still selfish at times, unkind, and often insensitive.

Overall it's been a year full of learning on all fronts. Bengaluru as a city is pretty. It's not just the weather. I finally got the metro to my side of the city, but I dearly miss my BMTC bus rides. I spent this year's end in my village. A man can achieve many things and he may go to the moon, but home is what keeps us grounded, isn't it? 

That's it. I went deep into music this year. Here are my playlists. If you like my taste, we're buddies already. Thank you for reading. I hope you also had a meaningful year behind. Let's hope for the new year to be full of healthy surprises.
